# Specification Quality Checklist: Basic Module Shapes for QR Codes

**Purpose**: ✅ Validate specification completeness and quality - **COMPLETED**
**Analysis Result**: All requirements validated against existing implementation
**Created**: 2025-01-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: Requirements validation successful - feature already fully implemented

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- ✅ Specification validation completed against existing implementation
- ✅ All functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-010) are satisfied
- ✅ All success criteria (SC-001 to SC-005) are met or exceeded
- ✅ Implementation includes 14 shapes (75% more than 8+ requirement)
- ✅ Architecture follows Pydantic v2 + MyPy best practices
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and documentation in place
- ✅ No implementation work required - feature already complete

## Validation Summary

**Outcome**: This specification served as a successful validation exercise for a pre-existing feature. The SegnoMMS codebase already provides a robust, professional implementation that exceeds all specification requirements in both functionality and quality.
