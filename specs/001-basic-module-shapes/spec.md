# Feature Specification: Basic Module Shapes for QR Codes

**Feature Branch**: `001-basic-module-shapes`
**Created**: 2025-01-25
**Status**: Implemented (Pre-existing)
**Implementation Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - All requirements already satisfied in existing codebase
**Input**: User description: "Basic module shapes for QR codes - Allow users to generate QR codes where individual modules can be rendered as different shapes like circles, squares, rounded rectangles, diamonds, stars, and hexagons for aesthetic customization"

> **Note**: This specification was created to document and validate an existing feature. Analysis shows that SegnoMMS already implements all requested functionality with 14+ shapes, exceeding the specification requirements. This spec serves as formal documentation and requirements validation for the pre-existing implementation.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Generate QR with Basic Shape Selection (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to create a visually appealing QR code by changing the default square modules to a different basic shape like circles or rounded rectangles for branding or aesthetic purposes.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables basic shape customization. Without this, users cannot access any shape options beyond default squares.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating a QR code with a specified shape parameter and verifying the SVG output contains the correct shape elements. Delivers immediate visual customization value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a QR code content and shape parameter "circle", **When** the user generates the QR code, **Then** all data modules are rendered as circles instead of squares
2. **Given** a QR code content and shape parameter "rounded", **When** the user generates the QR code, **Then** all data modules are rendered as rounded rectangles with appropriate corner radius
3. **Given** a QR code content with no shape specified, **When** the user generates the QR code, **Then** the system defaults to square modules (backward compatibility)

---

### User Story 2 - Shape-Specific Customization Parameters (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to fine-tune shape appearance by adjusting shape-specific parameters like corner radius for rounded shapes or point count for star shapes to achieve precise visual design.

**Why this priority**: Enables professional customization beyond basic shape selection. Provides the flexibility needed for brand-specific requirements.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting shape-specific parameters and verifying the generated SVG reflects those parameter values in the shape geometry.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a rounded shape with corner_radius=0.3, **When** the QR code is generated, **Then** the rounded rectangles have the specified corner radius
2. **Given** a star shape with point_count=6, **When** the QR code is generated, **Then** each star module has exactly 6 points
3. **Given** a diamond shape with no additional parameters, **When** the QR code is generated, **Then** the system uses default diamond proportions

---

### User Story 3 - Multiple Shape Categories Support (Priority: P3)

A developer wants to choose from various shape categories (geometric, organic, symbolic) to match different design themes and aesthetic requirements.

**Why this priority**: Provides comprehensive shape library for diverse use cases. Expands creative possibilities for different design contexts.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating QR codes with each available shape category and verifying correct rendering for each type.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** geometric shapes (square, circle, diamond, hexagon), **When** any is selected, **Then** the modules render with precise geometric properties
2. **Given** organic shapes (rounded, dot), **When** any is selected, **Then** the modules render with smooth, organic appearance
3. **Given** symbolic shapes (star, plus), **When** any is selected, **Then** the modules render with correct symbolic representation

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when shape parameters are invalid or out of range (e.g., negative corner radius)?
- How does the system handle shape rendering when QR modules are very small (high density codes)?
- What occurs when shape complexity would compromise QR code scannability?
- How does the system behave with extreme parameter values that could break SVG rendering?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
