# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]

## SegnoMMS Integration Requirements *(mandatory for SegnoMMS features)*

### Plugin Architecture Compliance
- Feature MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing Segno plugin API
- Configuration changes MUST preserve existing kwargs API patterns
- New shape renderers MUST follow factory pattern implementation
- Multi-phase pipeline integration MUST respect Phase 1-4 architecture

### Type Safety Requirements
- All configuration models MUST use Pydantic v2 with strict MyPy compliance
- Enum objects at runtime (no `use_enum_values=True`)
- TypedDict patterns for type-safe **kwargs where applicable
- Discriminated unions for shape-specific configurations when relevant

### Testing Requirements
- MUST include comprehensive test coverage across all categories:
  - Unit tests (>90% coverage)
  - Integration tests (cross-module interaction)
  - Visual regression tests (for shape/rendering changes)
  - Structural tests (SVG validation)
  - Performance tests (benchmarking and regression detection)
- Backward compatibility testing across Segno versions 1.5.2 to 1.6.6
- Visual baselines MUST be established for any rendering changes

### Documentation Requirements
- User-facing documentation MUST be written in Sphinx/RST format
- API documentation auto-generated from comprehensive docstrings
- Configuration examples with JSON output validation
- Visual examples generated and validated from test baselines

### Quality Gates
- MUST pass all pre-commit hooks without `--no-verify`
- MyPy type checking with zero errors for new code
- Security scanning with bandit
- Performance benchmarks within established thresholds

### Commercial Standards
- Professional SVG output with accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 compliance)
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Production-ready logging and monitoring integration
- Security-conscious input processing (defensive practices only)

## Assumptions *(document reasonable defaults)*

### Technology Assumptions
- Uses established SegnoMMS technology stack (see `.specify/memory/research.md`)
- Follows existing Pydantic v2 + MyPy patterns (see `.specify/memory/architecture-overview.md`)
- Integrates with current testing framework and CI/CD pipeline
- Respects existing documentation policy (Sphinx-first, see CLAUDE.md)

### Architecture Assumptions
- Works within multi-phase processing pipeline
- Leverages existing shape renderer factory pattern
- Utilizes established configuration validation system
- Maintains plugin architecture integrity

### Quality Assumptions
- Maintains >90% test coverage standard
- Follows established performance benchmarks
- Respects existing visual regression testing patterns
- Aligns with commercial QR generation service standards
