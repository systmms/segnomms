Contributing to SegnoMMS
========================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SegnoMMS! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

Development Setup
-----------------

1. **Clone the repository:**

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/your-org/segnomms.git
      cd segnomms

2. **Set up development environment:**

   .. code-block:: bash

      make setup

3. **Install pre-commit hooks:**

   .. code-block:: bash

      pre-commit install

Development Workflow
--------------------

Code Quality Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **MyPy:** All code must pass strict type checking with zero errors
- **Black:** All Python code must be formatted with Black
- **isort:** All imports must be properly sorted and organized
- **flake8:** All code must pass linting checks
- **Tests:** All existing tests must pass before committing

Running Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run all tests
   make test

   # Run specific test categories
   make test-unit
   make test-integration
   make test-visual
   make test-structural
   make test-performance

   # Run quick tests during development
   make test-quick

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Update documentation when adding new features
- All public APIs must have comprehensive docstrings
- Run ``make docs`` to build documentation locally
- Documentation uses Sphinx with RST format

Git Commit Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**NEVER use ``--no-verify`` flag with git commits.**

- Pre-commit hooks exist to maintain code quality and consistency
- All formatting, linting, and type checking issues must be resolved before committing
- If pre-commit hooks fail, fix the underlying issues rather than bypassing them

Submitting Changes
------------------

1. **Create a feature branch:**

   .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

2. **Make your changes:**

   - Write code following the established patterns
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes:**

   .. code-block:: bash

      make test
      make docs

4. **Commit your changes:**

   .. code-block:: bash

      git add .
      git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"

5. **Push and create a pull request:**

   .. code-block:: bash

      git push origin feature/your-feature-name

Code Review Process
-------------------

1. All changes must be reviewed via pull request
2. Ensure all CI checks pass
3. Address any review feedback
4. Maintain clean commit history
